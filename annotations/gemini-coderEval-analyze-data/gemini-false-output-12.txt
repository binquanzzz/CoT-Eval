prompt:
Call the given command(s).

steps:
1. Step 1: Construct the command list to be executed by `subprocess.Popen`. This involves combining the `commands` list and the `args` list into a single list.
2. Step 2: Prepare the arguments for `subprocess.Popen`. This includes setting the `cwd` (current working directory), `env` (environment variables), `stdout` (standard output), and `stderr` (standard error) based on the function's input parameters.
3. Step 3: Handle standard output and standard error streams. Set `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` to capture the standard output. For standard error, if `hide_stderr` is True, redirect it to `/dev/null` using `subprocess.DEVNULL`; otherwise, redirect it to `subprocess.PIPE` to capture it, or potentially leave it as default to inherit from the parent process. For simplicity and based on the problem description to return result (stdout and returncode), we will capture stderr as well and decide later if we want to hide it from the returned result, but in this case, 'hide\_stderr' seems to be more about suppressing the display during execution rather than in the return. Based on description and common practice, 'hide\_stderr' usually means to silence stderr output, thus redirecting to `subprocess.DEVNULL` if true and capturing it if false.
4. Step 4: Execute the command using `subprocess.Popen`.
5. Step 5: If `verbose` is True, print the command being executed before running it. Construct the command string from the list of command and args for printing.
6. Step 6: Wait for the subprocess to complete and get the standard output, standard error, and return code. Use `process.communicate()` to get stdout and stderr, and `process.returncode` to get the return code.
7. Step 7: Decode the standard output (and standard error if captured) from bytes to string, assuming UTF-8 encoding.
8. Step 8: Return the standard output and the return code.

General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging

steps:
1. Import the `logging` module, which is essential for logging functionalities in Python.
2. Create a logger instance using `logging.getLogger(name)`. This creates or retrieves a logger with the specified name.
3. Set the logging level. If the `debug` argument is True, set the logger level to `logging.DEBUG`. Otherwise, set it to `logging.INFO` to capture less verbose information.
4. Create a file handler using `logging.FileHandler(logfile)` to direct log messages to the specified log file.
5. Create a formatter using `logging.Formatter(...)` to define the format of log messages. Include elements like timestamp, logger name, log level, and the message itself.
6. Add the formatter to the file handler using `file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)` to apply the defined format to the log entries written to the file.
7. Add the file handler to the logger using `logger.addHandler(file_handler)` to instruct the logger to send its messages to the file handler, and thus to the log file.
8. Return the configured logger object so it can be used to log messages throughout the application.

You should not need to use this method unless you want to deserialize

steps:
1.  Initialize an empty list called `bookmarks` to store the created `Bookmark` objects.
2.  Iterate through each `raw_value` in the input list `values`. This represents processing each raw bookmark string one by one.
3.  For each `raw_value`, split the string into parts based on a delimiter. Let's assume the delimiter is a comma ",". This will separate the raw string into its constituent components (like URL, title, tags, etc.).
4.  Extract the URL from the first part of the split string.
5.  Extract the title from the second part of the split string.
6.  Extract the tags from the remaining parts of the split string, if any. If there are more parts after URL and title, consider them as tags. Collect these tags into a list.
7.  Create a `Bookmark` object using the extracted URL, title, and tags. Assume there is a `Bookmark` class available and its constructor accepts URL, title, and tags (as a list, which might be optional or could be None if no tags are present).
8.  Append the newly created `Bookmark` object to the `bookmarks` list.
9.  After processing all `raw_value` strings in the input `values` list, create a `Bookmarks` object using the accumulated list of `Bookmark` objects. Assume the `Bookmarks` class constructor takes a list of `Bookmark` objects as input.

prompt:
Return a (sequence, type) pair.
Sequence is derived from *seq*

steps:
1. Check if the input `seq` is already a sequence type. Python's built-in sequence types include `list`, `tuple`, `str`, `bytes`, and `bytearray`. We can use `isinstance()` to check if `seq` belongs to any of these types.
2.If `seq` is a sequence type, then the sequence to be returned is `seq` itself. Determine the type of `seq` using the `type()` function. The function should return a tuple `(seq, type(seq))`.
3. If `seq` is not a sequence type, then it needs to be converted into a sequence. Convert `seq` into a list using `list(seq)`.
4.Determine the type of the sequence obtained in the previous step. In the case of conversion, the type will be `list`.
5.Return a tuple containing the sequence obtained in step 2 or step 3 and its type obtained in step 2 or step 4, i.e., `(sequence, type)`.

Histograms with scale equal to zero can't be rescaled.

steps:
1. Step 1: Check if the argument `other` is None. If it is None, proceed to handle the case of returning or computing the current scale of the histogram.
2. Step 2: If `other` is None, check if the scale of the histogram has already been computed and stored. Assume there is an attribute, for instance `_scale`, to store the computed scale.
3. Step 3: If the scale has not been computed yet or if the `recompute` flag is set to True, compute the scale. This is done by summing up the values of all bins in the histogram. Store the computed scale for future use, for example in the `_scale` attribute.
4. Step 4: If the scale was already computed (and `recompute` is False), return the stored scale. If the scale was just computed in step 3, return the newly computed scale.
5. Step 5: If `other` is not None (meaning a float value is provided for rescaling), first check if the current scale of the histogram is equal to zero. If it is zero, raise a `LenaValueError` as rescaling a histogram with zero scale is not allowed.
6. Step 6: If the current scale is not zero, rescale the histogram to the new scale `other`. This involves multiplying each bin value by the ratio of the new scale to the current scale. After rescaling, update the stored scale to the new scale `other` and return None or self (returning None for simplicity here).
