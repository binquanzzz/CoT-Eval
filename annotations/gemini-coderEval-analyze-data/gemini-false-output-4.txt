prompt:
Reduce a list of base classes to its ordered minimum equivalent

steps:
1. Step 1: Initialize an empty list called `minimal_bases` to store the classes that are minimal bases.
2. Step 2: Get a list of all class names from the keys of the input dictionary `classes`. Let's call this list `all_classes`.
3. Step 3: Iterate through each class name `current_class` in `all_classes`.
4. Step 4: For each `current_class`, initialize a boolean variable `is_superclass` to `False`.
5. Step 5: Iterate through all other class names `other_class` in `all_classes`.
6. Step 6: Inside the inner loop, check if `current_class` is present in the list of superclasses of `other_class`. Access the list of superclasses of `other_class` using `classes[other_class]`. Then check if `current_class` is in this list.
7. Step 7: If `current_class` is found in the superclasses of `other_class`, it means `current_class` is a superclass of `other_class`. Therefore, `current_class` is NOT a minimal base. Set `is_superclass = True` and break out of the inner loop.
8. Step 8: After the inner loop completes, check the value of `is_superclass`. If `is_superclass` is still `False`, it means `current_class` is not a superclass of any other class in the input. Therefore, it is a minimal base.
9. Step 9: If `is_superclass` is `False`, append `current_class` to the `minimal_bases` list.
10. Step 10: After the outer loop completes, return the `minimal_bases` list.

prompt:
Return attribute names and descriptions defined by interface.

steps:
1. Access the class dictionary using `self.__class__.__dict__` to get all attributes of the class.
2. Initialize an empty list called `attribute_list` to store the name and description tuples.
3. Iterate through each `name` and `attribute` in the class dictionary's items using a `for` loop.
4. Check the `all` flag. If `all` is `False`, then proceed to filter out special attributes. If `all` is `True`, skip to step 6.
5. If `all` is `False`, check if the attribute `name` starts with '__'. If it does, use `continue` to skip to the next iteration, effectively ignoring special attributes.
6. Initialize `description` to `None`. This will be the default description if no docstring is found.
7. Check if the `attribute` is callable using `callable(attribute)`. Callable attributes are typically methods or functions which might have docstrings.
8. If the `attribute` is callable, access its docstring using `attribute.__doc__`. Assign this docstring to the `description` variable. If `attribute.__doc__` is None, `description` will remain `None` as initialized.
9. Append a tuple containing the `name` of the attribute and its `description` to the `attribute_list`. The tuple should be in the format `(name, description)`.
10. After iterating through all attributes, return the `attribute_list`. This list contains tuples of attribute names and their descriptions (docstrings if available and attribute is callable, otherwise None).

prompt:
Return the attribute names defined by the interface.

steps:
1. Step 1: Get all attribute names using the `dir()` function on the instance `self`. This function returns a list of strings containing names in the scope of `self`, including attributes and methods.
2. Step 2: Check the boolean value of the `all` parameter. If `all` is `True`, proceed to step 4. If `all` is `False` (or not provided, as it defaults to `False`), proceed to step 3.
3. Step 3: Filter the list of names obtained in step 1. Iterate through each name in the list. For each name, check if it starts with '__' and ends with '__'. If a name starts and ends with '__', it is typically considered a special method or attribute in Python and should be excluded when `all=False`. Create a new list containing only the names that do not start and end with '__'.
4. Step 4: If `all` is `True`, use the original list of names obtained in step 1 without any filtering.
5. Step 5: Return the filtered list of names (from step 3) if `all` was `False`, or the unfiltered list of names (from step 4) if `all` was `True`. This list contains the attribute names of the current class instance.

prompt:
Normalize declaration arguments

Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
interfaces.

Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.

steps:
1. First, initialize an empty list called `normalized_args`. If an `output` list is provided as an argument, use it as `normalized_args`; otherwise, create a new empty list.
2. Second, iterate through each `item` in the input `sequence`.
3. Third, for each `item`, check if it is considered an "individual interface" or an "implements spec".  How to identify these is not specified, so we will assume there are functions `is_individual_interface(item)` and `is_implements_spec(item)` to check these conditions.
4. Fourth, if the `item` is identified as either an "individual interface" or an "implements spec" (i.e., `is_individual_interface(item)` is true or `is_implements_spec(item)` is true), append this `item` directly to the `normalized_args` list.
5. Fifth, if the `item` is not identified as an "individual interface" or "implements spec", it implies it's something that needs to be "expanded" like a Declaration or a tuple.  In this case, assume the `item` is iterable. Iterate through each element within this `item`. For every `sub_item` in `item`, append this `sub_item` to the `normalized_args` list. This step effectively "expands" tuples and Declarations by adding their constituent elements to the `normalized_args` list.
6. Sixth, after iterating through all items in the input `sequence`, return the `normalized_args` list.

prompt:
Return the C optimization module, if available, otherwise
a false value.

If the optimizations are required but not available, this
raises the ImportError.

This does not say whether they should be used or not.

steps:
1. Understand the purpose of the function: The function `_c_optimizations_available()` aims to check if a C optimization module is available and return it if it is, otherwise return a false value.
2. Determine how to check for module availability: In Python, module availability is typically checked by attempting to import the module. If the import succeeds, the module is available; if it fails (raises an `ImportError`), the module is not available.
3. Implement the import attempt using a `try-except` block:  Use a `try` block to attempt to import the C optimization module. If an `ImportError` occurs during the import, it should be caught in an `except` block.
4. Decide on a name for the C optimization module to attempt to import:  While the exact name isn't specified, a common convention for C optimization modules is to use names like `_speedups`, `_cext`, or similar. Let's assume a plausible name is `_speedups` for demonstration purposes. *Self-correction: It's better to use a more generic placeholder name or consider common patterns. Let's use `_module_name` as a placeholder initially and then refine if needed. Let's assume a concrete example, `_my_c_optimizations`.*
5. Handle successful import: If the import within the `try` block is successful, it means the C optimization module is available. In this case, the function should return the imported module itself.
6. Handle import error: If an `ImportError` is caught, it means the C optimization module is not available. In this case, the function should return a false value, as indicated in the docstring.  `False` is a suitable false value.
7. Construct the `try-except` block: Import the assumed C optimization module within the `try` block. Return the imported module in the `try` block. Catch `ImportError` in the `except` block and return `False`.
8. Consider edge cases or refinements: For this simple function, there aren't many obvious edge cases. The core logic is import attempt and error handling.  We can make the module name more configurable or try multiple module names if needed in a more complex scenario, but for this function as presented, a single module name check is sufficient.
9. Finalize the function structure with the chosen module name and return values.

Reset the histogram.

Current context is reset to an empty dict.
Bins are reinitialized with the *initial_value*
or with *make_bins()* (depending on the initialization).

steps:
1. Access the `context` attribute of the class instance (`self`) and reset it to an empty dictionary `{}`.
2. Check if the class instance (`self`) has an attribute named `make_bins`. This attribute should be a callable function.
3. If the `make_bins` attribute exists, call the `make_bins` function associated with the class instance (`self.make_bins()`) and assign the returned value to the `bins` attribute of the class instance (`self.bins`).
4. If the `make_bins` attribute does not exist, check if the class instance (`self`) has an attribute named `initial_value`. This attribute should hold the initial value for bins.
5. If the `initial_value` attribute exists, assign the value of `initial_value` attribute of the class instance (`self.initial_value`) to the `bins` attribute of the class instance (`self.bins`).
6. If neither `make_bins` nor `initial_value` attributes exist, the `bins` attribute is not explicitly reinitialized in this method based on the provided description.
