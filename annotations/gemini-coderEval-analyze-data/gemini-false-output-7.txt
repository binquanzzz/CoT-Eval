prompt:
Validate fixity block in inventory.

Check the structure of the fixity block and makes sure that only files
listed in the manifest are referenced.

steps:
1. Check if the `fixity` input is a dictionary. If not, it's structurally invalid. Report an error indicating that the fixity block is not a dictionary and return `False`.
2. Initialize an empty set called `manifest_file_set` by converting the input list `manifest_files` into a set. This will allow for efficient checking of whether a file path from the fixity block is present in the manifest.
3. Initialize an empty set called `fixity_files_in_manifest` to keep track of all file paths found in the fixity block that are also in the manifest.
4. Iterate through each `algorithm` (e.g., 'sha256', 'md5') in the `fixity` dictionary.
5. For each `algorithm`, check if the value associated with it in the `fixity` dictionary is a dictionary itself. If not, it's structurally invalid. Report an error indicating that the fixity information for the algorithm is not a dictionary and return `False`.
6. For each `algorithm`, iterate through each `filepath` in the dictionary associated with that `algorithm`. These filepaths are keys in the inner dictionary.
7. For each `filepath` extracted from the fixity block, check if this `filepath` exists in the `manifest_file_set`.
8. If a `filepath` from the fixity block is found in the `manifest_file_set`, add this `filepath` to the `fixity_files_in_manifest` set.
9. If a `filepath` from the fixity block is *not* found in the `manifest_file_set`, it means a file is referenced in the fixity block that is not listed in the manifest. This is an error. Report an error indicating that the file in the fixity block is not in the manifest and return `False`.
10. After iterating through all algorithms and filepaths in the fixity block, if no errors have been reported so far, it means the fixity block is structurally valid and all referenced files are in the manifest. Return `True` to indicate successful validation.

prompt:
Group files by their XML basename

Groups files by their XML basename and returns data in dict format.

Parameters
----------
xml_filename : str
    XML filenames
files : list
    list of files in the folder or zipfile

Returns
-------
dict
    key: name of the XML files
    value: Package

steps:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary called `grouped_files` to store the results. This dictionary will map base XML filenames to lists of associated files.
2. Iterate through each `xml_file` in the input list `xmls`.
3. For each `xml_file`, extract the base filename of the XML file. This can be done by removing the file extension (e.g., '.xml') from the filename. Let's call this `xml_base_filename`.
4. Create a new entry in the `grouped_files` dictionary with `xml_base_filename` as the key and an empty list as the value. This list will store files associated with this XML.
5. Iterate through each `file_path` in the input list `files`.
6. For each `file_path`, extract the base filename of the file. Let's call this `file_basename`.
7. Check if the `file_basename` starts with the `xml_base_filename`. This assumes that files related to an XML file will have filenames that start with the base name of the XML file.
8. If the `file_basename` starts with the `xml_base_filename`, append the `file_path` to the list associated with `xml_base_filename` in the `grouped_files` dictionary.
9. After processing all XML files and files, return the `grouped_files` dictionary.

steps:
1. Get the list of all items (files and directories) present in the input `folder` path. This can be achieved using the `os.listdir()` function.
2. Iterate through each item obtained in the previous step. For each item, check if it is a file or a directory. We are only interested in files for this function. Use `os.path.isfile()` to check if an item is a file.
3. For each item that is identified as a file, construct its full absolute path. This is done by joining the input `folder` path with the filename using `os.path.join()`.
4. Assume there is a function named `_group_files_by_xml_filename` already defined elsewhere. Call this function, passing the list of full file paths collected in the previous steps as an argument.
5. Return the value returned by the `_group_files_by_xml_filename` function. This will be the grouped files as described in the function's docstring.

5. Check if the lowercase file extension corresponds to "pdf".
6. If the file extension is "pdf", create a dictionary with a single key "component_id" and its value as the provided `file_path`. Return this dictionary.
7. If the file extension is not "pdf" (and also not "xml" as handled in step 4), determine a file type identifier (`ftype`). For simplicity, we can use the extracted file extension as `ftype`.
8. Create a dictionary with keys "component_id", "file_path", and "ftype".

8. Eighth, check if the current word is one of the supplement keywords, such as "supp", "suppl", or "supplement".
9. Ninth, if a supplement keyword is found, check if there is a next word in the list. If there is a next word, attempt to convert the next word to an integer.

Given an `args` sequence of expressions, return a new list of expression
applying absorption and negative absorption.

Absorption::

    A & (A | B) = A, A | (A & B) = A

Negative absorption::

    A & (~A | B) = A & B, A | (~A & B) = A | B

steps:
1. Initialize an empty list called `absorbed_args` to store the resulting expressions after absorption.
2. Iterate through each expression `arg` in the input list `args`.
3. For each `arg`, check if it represents an OR operation. Assume there is a method `is_or()` for expression objects that returns `True` if it is an OR operation and `False` otherwise.
4. If `arg` is an OR operation, get its operands. Assume there is a method `operands()` that returns a list of operands for an expression. Let's call the operands of `arg` as `or_operands`.
5. Iterate through each operand `op1` in `or_operands`.
6. For each `op1`, check if it represents an AND operation using `op1.is_and()`.
7. If `op1` is an AND operation, get its operands, let's call them `and_operands`.
8. Iterate through the remaining operands `op2` in `or_operands` (where `op2` is not `op1`).
9. For each `and_operand` in `and_operands`, compare it with `op2`. Assume expressions can be compared using `==`.
10. If any `and_operand` is equal to `op2`, it means we can apply the absorption rule: `op2 OR (op2 AND ...) = op2`. In this case, the absorbed expression is `op2`. Replace `arg` with `op2` and break from the inner loops to avoid further unnecessary checks for this `arg`.
11. If the OR absorption rule was not applied (meaning `arg` was not replaced in step 10), then check if `arg` represents an AND operation using `arg.is_and()`.
12. If `arg` is an AND operation, get its operands, let's call them `and_operands`.
13. Iterate through each operand `op1` in `and_operands`.

Returns:
    callable: Decorator for registering listeners for the specified
    hook.

steps:
1. Define a class named `EventHandler` to encapsulate the hook registry and the `on` decorator.
```
2. Inside the `EventHandler` class, create an `__init__` method. In the `__init__` method, initialize an empty dictionary called `self.handlers` to store the hook handlers. This dictionary will store hook names as keys and lists of handler functions as values.
```
3. Define the `on` method within the `EventHandler` class. The `on` method should take `self` (the instance of `EventHandler`) and `hook` (the name of the hook to register the handler for) as arguments.
```
4. Inside the `on` method, define a decorator function. This decorator function will take a function `func` (the method being decorated) as an argument.
```
5. Within the decorator function, access the `self.handlers` dictionary of the `EventHandler` instance.
```
6. Check if the `hook` already exists as a key in `self.handlers`.
```
7. If the `hook` exists as a key, append the decorated function `func` to the list of handlers associated with that `hook` (i.e., `self.handlers[hook]`).
```
8. If the `hook` does not exist as a key, create a new entry in `self.handlers` with `hook` as the key and a list containing `func` as the value (i.e., `self.handlers[hook] = [func]`).
```
9. The decorator function should return the original function `func` to ensure the decorated method remains usable.
```
10. The `on` method should return the decorator function.
