prompt:
Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves
up to `maxsize` results based on a Least Frequently Used (LFU)
algorithm.

steps:
1. Define the `lfu_cache` decorator function that accepts `maxsize` and `typed` as arguments with default values of 128 and False respectively.
2. Inside `lfu_cache`, initialize two dictionaries: `cache` to store the cached results (key-value pairs of arguments and results) and `frequencies` to track the access count for each key.
3. Define a nested function `lfu_decorator` that takes the function `user_function` as an argument. This is the actual decorator.
4. Inside `lfu_decorator`, define the `wrapper` function that will be returned when the decorator is applied. This function will accept `*args` and `**kwargs` to handle any function arguments.
5. Within the `wrapper` function, construct the cache key. If `typed` is True, the key should be a tuple containing the function arguments and their types. Otherwise, it should just be a tuple of the function arguments. Handle both positional and keyword arguments. Ensure keyword arguments are consistently ordered in the key (e.g., sort them by name).
6. Check if the generated `key` exists in the `cache`.
7. If the `key` is in the `cache` (cache hit):
    a. Increment the access count for this `key` in the `frequencies` dictionary.
    b. Return the cached value from the `cache`.
8. If the `key` is not in the `cache` (cache miss):
    a. Call the original `user_function` with `*args` and `**kwargs` to compute the `value`.
    b. Check if the cache is full (i.e., if the number of keys in `cache` is greater than or equal to `maxsize`).
    c. If the cache is full:
        i. Find the key with the minimum frequency in the `frequencies` dictionary. If there are multiple keys with the same minimum frequency, any of them can be chosen for eviction (e.g., the first one found during iteration).
        ii. Remove the least frequently used key and its corresponding value from both the `cache` and `frequencies` dictionaries.
    d. Add the new `key` and its computed `value` to the `cache`.
    e. Initialize the frequency count for the new `key` in the `frequencies` dictionary to 1.
    f. Return the computed `value`.
9. Use `@functools.wraps(user_function)` to preserve the metadata of the original function in the `wrapper` function.
10. In `lfu_decorator`, return the `wrapper` function.
11. In `lfu_cache`, return the `lfu_decorator` function.

name: get

prompt:
D.get(k[,d]) -> D[k] if k in D, else d.  d defaults to None.

steps:
1. Step 1: Understand the function signature and purpose. The function `get` is defined as a method within a class (indicated by the `self` parameter). It takes two arguments: `key` which represents the key to be searched, and `default` which is an optional argument that specifies the value to be returned if the key is not found. If `default` is not provided, it defaults to `None`. The docstring clarifies that the method should return the value associated with `key` if it exists within the class instance; otherwise, it should return the `default` value.
2. Step 2: Check if an attribute with the name specified by `key` exists in the current instance of the class (`self`).  In Python, you can use the `hasattr(self, key)` function to check if an object `self` has an attribute with the name given by the string `key`. This function will return `True` if the attribute exists and `False` otherwise.
3. Step 3: If the attribute (key) exists, return its value. If `hasattr(self, key)` returns `True`, it means that an attribute named `key` exists in the object `self`. To retrieve the value of this attribute, you can use the `getattr(self, key)` function. This function will return the value of the attribute `key` from the object `self`. This value should then be returned by the `get` method.
4. Step 4: If the attribute (key) does not exist, return the `default` value. If `hasattr(self, key)` returns `False`, it means that an attribute named `key` does not exist in the object `self`. In this case, the method should return the value of the `default` parameter that was passed to the `get` method. If no `default` argument was provided when the `get` method was called, the method should return the default value specified in the function definition, which is `None`.

prompt:
Decorator to wrap a class or instance method with a memoizing
callable that saves results in a cache.

steps:
1. Define the `cachedmethod` function that takes `cache`, `key` (defaulting to `hashkey`), and `lock` (defaulting to `None`) as arguments. This function will act as the decorator factory.
2. Define an inner function, let's call it `decorator`, within `cachedmethod`. This function will take the method to be decorated (`method`) as an argument.
3. Define another inner function, let's call it `wrapper`, within `decorator`. This `wrapper` function will be executed when the decorated method is called. It should accept arbitrary arguments `*args` and keyword arguments `**kwargs` to match any method signature.
4. Inside the `wrapper` function, generate the cache key by calling the provided `key` function with the arguments passed to the `wrapper` function: `cache_key = key(*args, **kwargs)`.
5. Check if the `cache_key` exists in the `cache`.
6. If a `lock` is provided, acquire the lock before accessing the cache to ensure thread safety.
7. If the `cache_key` is found in the `cache`, retrieve the cached result from the `cache`.
8. If a `lock` was acquired, release the lock after retrieving the result.
9. If the `cache_key` is found, return the cached result.
10. If the `cache_key` is not found in the `cache`, call the original `method` with the provided `*args` and `**kwargs` to compute the result: `result = method(*args, **kwargs)`.
11. If a `lock` is provided, acquire the lock before updating the cache to ensure thread safety.
12. Store the computed `result` in the `cache` using the `cache_key` as the key.

steps:
1.  **Step 1: Initialize an empty string to store the formatted exception information.** This string will be built up in subsequent steps and returned as the final output.
2.  **Step 2: Extract the exception type name from the exception object `e`.** Get the class of the exception object and retrieve its name (e.g., 'ValueError', 'TypeError').
3.  **Step 3: Extract the exception message (arguments) from the exception object `e`.** Access the `args` attribute of the exception object, which is a tuple containing the arguments passed when the exception was raised. Convert these arguments into a user-friendly string representation. If there are multiple arguments, format them appropriately (e.g., comma-separated). If there are no arguments, represent it as an empty string or a default message like "No message".
4.  **Step 4: Check if the exception object `e` has a traceback.** Traceback information is usually available when an exception is caught in an `except` block or when an uncaught exception occurs. Access the traceback using `e.__traceback__`.
5.  **Step 5: If a traceback exists, iterate through the traceback frames.**  The traceback is a linked list of frames. For each frame, extract relevant information such as filename, line number, function name, and the line of code. Limit the number of traceback levels to be processed based on `max_level`.
6.  **Step 6: For each traceback frame, format the file path according to `max_path_level`.** If `max_path_level` is a positive integer, shorten the file path by only keeping the last `max_path_level` directories and the filename. If `max_path_level` is 0, maybe show only the filename. If `max_path_level` is negative or None, show the full path.
7.  **Step 7: Format each traceback frame into a readable string.** Include the formatted file path, line number, function name, and the line of code.
8.  **Step 8: Append the exception type and message to the output string.** Start the output string with the exception type name and its message.
9.  **Step 9: If traceback information was processed, append the formatted traceback frames to the output string.**  Format the traceback information clearly, possibly with indentation to distinguish it from the exception type and message.
10. **Step 10: Return the complete formatted string.** This string represents the exception information in a readable format.

2. Open the file specified by `file_name` using the `open()` function. Use the determined mode ('w' or 'a') and the provided `encoding` for opening the file. It is recommended to use a `with open(...) as file:` statement to ensure the file is automatically closed after writing.
3. Inside the `with open(...)` block, use the `file.write()` method to write the content of the `text_buffer` to the opened file object `file`. This will write the text from the buffer to the file.

prompt:
Reset

steps:
1. **Step 1: Get the Root Logger Object**
Obtain the root logger instance from the Python logging module. This is the base logger that typically influences all other loggers unless they are explicitly configured differently.

**Step 2: Remove All Existing Handlers from the Root Logger**>
Iterate through the list of handlers currently attached to the root logger and remove each one. Handlers are responsible for directing log messages to various destinations (like console, files, network sockets, etc.). Removing all handlers ensures a clean slate for output routing.

**Step 3: Remove All Existing Filters from the Root Logger**
Iterate through the list of filters currently attached to the root logger and remove each one. Filters are used to conditionally process log records, allowing only certain messages to pass through. Removing all filters ensures no message filtering is in place initially.

**Step 4: Reset the Log Level of the Root Logger to NOTSET**
Set the logging level of the root logger to `logging.NOTSET`. This level is the lowest possible level and effectively means that the root logger will process all log messages and pass them on to its handlers (if any are added later). By setting it to `NOTSET`, you are essentially removing any level-based filtering at the root logger itself, allowing child loggers or newly configured handlers to determine the effective logging level.

**Step 5: (Optional but good practice) Clear any cached loggers if necessary for a truly fresh state**
In some scenarios, especially in testing environments or complex applications, logging configurations might be cached or persisted in ways that aren't directly tied to the root logger's handlers and filters. If a more thorough reset is needed in those specific cases, consider exploring if there are any mechanisms to clear internal logger caches or states, although this is less common for typical "reset logging system" scenarios and might depend heavily on the specific logging setup in use. For most standard use cases, steps 1-4 are sufficient for resetting the logging system to a default state.

prompt:
Merge multiple orderings so that within-ordering order is preserved

Orderings are constrained in such a way that if an object appears
in two or more orderings, then the suffix that begins with the
object must be in both orderings.

For example:

>>> _mergeOrderings([
... ['x', 'y', 'z'],
... ['q', 'z'],
... [1, 3, 5],
... ['z']
... ])
['x', 'y', 'q', 1, 3, 5, 'z']

steps:
1. Initialize an empty list called `merged_ordering` to store the combined and de-duplicated order.
2. Initialize an empty set called `seen_elements` to efficiently track elements that have already been added to `merged_ordering`. Sets provide fast membership checking.
3. Iterate through each list in the input `orderings`. Let's call the current list `current_list`.
4. For each `current_list`, iterate through each `element` within it.
5. For each `element`, check if it is already present in the `seen_elements` set.
6. If the `element` is NOT in `seen_elements`, it means this is the first time we are encountering this element in the combined orderings. In this case: a) Append the `element` to the `merged_ordering` list to maintain the order of first occurrence. b) Add the `element` to the `seen_elements` set to mark it as seen for future checks.
7. After iterating through all lists and elements, return the `merged_ordering` list, which now contains all unique elements from the input orderings in the sequence of their first appearance.

analyze:
Internal factors ----Cot and Prompt are inconsistent ----Cot steps are unreasonable
Step3, the generated code directly traverses the input list and elements in order, and there is no constraint on processing the sequential list.
