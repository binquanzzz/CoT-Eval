analyze:

The main reason is that in the TemplateView.get() method, the error patch calls self.get_context_data() directly, completely removing the kwargs pass. The correct patch should use self.get_context_data(**kwargs) to ensure that the URL keyword parameters can be correctly passed to the template context.

analyze:
model_patch did not change the class definition part of TruncDate and TruncTime, and did not give a complete class definition for TruncDate and TruncTime. The problem was only fixed in the as_sql method.

analyze:
CoT changed the access permissions of the method
The modification of model_patch renames the _build_app_dict method to build_app_dict, and changes in access rights of the build_app_dict method may cause some functions to fail to work properly, especially in view rendering, data loading, etc.

analyze:
Step 2 in CoT: Modify the json.dumps call: The fixing step clearly states that you want to modify the json.dumps call to add ensure_ascii=False parameter to prevent ASCII escaping. This is done in the rendering method of the Django form widget. It is not modified in model_patch.

analyze:
The CoT logic is too simple, and the generated code sanitize_separators(value) cannot correctly personalize the formatted input required by propt.

analyze:
model_patch changed the error message format of ValidationError
Changes may cause the ValidationError to change the format of the error message, causing some tests that rely on the original error message to fail. Form.errors.as_text() may return error text containing line breaks or additional tags, causing the ValidationError message format to not meet expectations.
