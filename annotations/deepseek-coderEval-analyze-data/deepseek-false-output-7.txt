prompt:
{

}

steps:

1. Check if the class has an attribute `_renditions`. If not, it should be initialized, possibly as a dictionary.
2. The method `add_rendition` is supposed to take `lang` and `file_path` as parameters.
3. According to the docstring, the method should assign the result of `self.filepath()` to `self._renditions[lang]`.
4. The parameter `file_path` is present but not used based on the docstring. It might be a mistake, but the code follows the given instructions.
5. Implement the method by calling `self.filepath()` and assigning the result to `self._renditions[lang]`.


generate_code:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath()

}

steps:

1. The method `add_asset` is part of a class and needs to assign a value to `self._assets[basename]`.
2. The value to assign is obtained by calling `self.filepath()`, which is a method of the class.
3. The `file_path` parameter is passed to `self.filepath()` to generate the correct file path.
4. The generated file path from `self.filepath(file_path)` is then stored in the `_assets` dictionary under the `basename` key.

name: _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element

prompt:
Extract the possible values of number and suppl from the contents of issue.

steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Desired Output**: The function needs to extract 'number' and 'sup' (supplement) from an 'issue' string. The string may contain a main number, a supplement, or both, formatted with variations like 'Suppl', 'Supplement', or 'Sup' followed by a number.

2. **Identify Patterns**: 
   - The main number is a standalone digit sequence.
   - The supplement is indicated by keywords followed by a digit sequence.
   - Both components can appear in various orders or alone.

3. **Design Regular Expression**:
   - Use regex to capture two scenarios:
     - Main number with optional supplement.
     - Supplement alone.
   - Handle case insensitivity and optional whitespace.

4. **Implement Regex with Groups**:
   - Named groups 'number' and 'sup' for main number and supplement.
   - Use alternation to handle both scenarios in a single regex.

5. **Process Match Groups**:
   - Extract 'number' and 'sup' from the matched groups.
   - Convert extracted strings to integers, handling missing values.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases with no valid number or supplement.
   - Strip input to manage leading/trailing spaces.


generate_code:

name: absorb

prompt:
Given an `args` sequence of expressions, return a new list of expression
applying absorption and negative absorption.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_law

Absorption::

    A & (A | B) = A, A | (A & B) = A

Negative absorption::

    A & (~A | B) = A & B, A | (~A & B) = A | B

steps:

1. **Understand Absorption Law**: Recognize that absorption in boolean algebra simplifies expressions like A �� (A �� B) to A and A �� (A �� B) to A.
2. **Check Expression Types**: For each expression in the input list, determine if it's an OR or AND operation.
3. **Decompose Expressions**: For OR expressions, split into left and right operands. Check if one operand is present in the list and the other is an AND/OR containing that operand.
4. **Absorption Conditions**:
   - For OR expressions, check if one operand exists in the list and the other is an AND with that operand.
   - For AND expressions, check if one operand exists in the list and the other is an OR with that operand.
5. **Filter Absorbed Expressions**: Collect expressions that do not meet the absorption conditions, ensuring they are retained in the result.
6. **Edge Cases Handling**: Ensure non-OR/AND expressions are kept and handle nested structures correctly by checking operand presence and types.

2. Initialize the configuration dictionary with the required top-level keys: "tls", "authentication", "authorization", "etcd", "docs", and "log".
3. For the "tls" key, create a sub-dictionary with "enabled" set to False, and default paths for "cert_path" and "key_path".
4. Set "authentication" and "authorization" to True if a user is provided, otherwise False.
5. For the "etcd" key, include the provided etcd_host and etcd_port in a sub-dictionary.

4. For HTML style: Wrap each piece in div tags and join with newlines.
5. For ANSI style: Add ANSI color codes around each piece (e.g., red text).
