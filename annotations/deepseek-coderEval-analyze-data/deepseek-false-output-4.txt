prompt:
Reduce a list of base classes to its ordered minimum equivalent

steps:

1. The task is to find classes in the input list that have no subclasses.
2. Each class in Python has a __subclasses__() method that returns its direct subclasses.
3. For a class to be considered a minimal base, it must have no subclasses at all.
4. Iterate over each class in the input list.
5. Check if the class's __subclasses__() method returns an empty list.
6. Collect all such classes into a result list and return it.

prompt:
Return attribute names and descriptions defined by interface.

steps:

1. Determine if the method should return class attributes or instance attributes. The method is part of a class instance (has 'self'), but "current class attribute" suggests class-level attributes.
2. Decide how to collect class attributes. Use self.__class__ to access the class of the instance.
3. Iterate over the class's attributes using dir(self.__class__) or inspect the class's __dict__.
4. Handle the 'all' parameter to include or exclude private attributes (those starting with '_').
5. Assume each relevant attribute has a 'description' attribute that holds its description.
6. Collect attribute names and their descriptions into a list of tuples.
7. Return the list after filtering based on the 'all' flag.

prompt:
Return the attribute names defined by the interface.

3. For 'all=False', retrieve the class's own attributes using self.__class__.__dict__.keys().
4. For 'all=True', retrieve all attributes, including inherited ones, using dir(self.__class__).
5. Convert the keys view to a list for consistency in return type.

Reset the histogram.

Current context is reset to an empty dict.
Bins are reinitialized with the *initial_value*

3. If 'initial_value' exists and is not None, assign it to the 'bins' attribute. This assumes that 'initial_value' is a valid initial state for the bins.

prompt:
Update *context* with the properties of this graph.

*context.error* is appended with indices of errors.
Example subcontext for a graph with fields "E,t,error_E_low":
{"error": {"x_low": {"index": 2}}}.
Note that error names are called "x", "y" and "z"
(this corresponds to first three coordinates,
if they are present), which allows to simplify plotting.
Existing values are not removed
from *context.value* and its subcontexts.

Called on "destruction" of the graph (for example,
in :class:`.ToCSV`). By destruction we mean conversion
to another structure (like text) in the flow.
The graph object is not really destroyed in this process.

steps:

1. **Extract Main Fields**: Identify the main fields by filtering out any fields that start with "error_".
2. **Iterate Over Fields**: Loop through each field along with its index to check if it's an error field.
3. **Process Error Fields**: For each error field, split the field name to extract the main part and error type.
4. **Validate Error Components**: Ensure the error field can be split into a main part and error type; skip if not possible.
5. **Check Main Field Existence**: Verify if the main part of the error field corresponds to a valid main field.
6. **Determine Coordinate**: Map the index of the main field to 'x', 'y', or 'z' based on its position in the main fields list.
7. **Construct Error Name**: Combine the coordinate and error type to form the error name (e.g., "x_low").
8. **Update Context**: Add the error name and its corresponding field index to the context's error dictionary without overwriting existing entries.

Their format is defined in :class:`.histogram` description.

2. Each bin's area is calculated as the bin height (value in bins) multiplied by its width (difference between consecutive edges).

Test whether *seq* can be converted to a FillRequestSeq.

True only if it is a FillRequest element
or contains at least one such,
and it is not a Source sequence.

steps:

1. Initialize two variables, low and high, to track the possible range of the balance (fills minus requests) starting at 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the input sequence:
   a. For each element, calculate the possible new balance range if the element is treated as a 'fill' (incrementing the balance) or a 'request' (decrementing the balance if possible).
   b. Update the low and high values based on the new possible ranges from both 'fill' and 'request' choices, ensuring the balance never drops below 0.
   c. If at any step the low exceeds the high, return False as it's impossible to form a valid sequence.
3. After processing all elements, check if the final balance range includes 0, meaning a valid sequence is possible.

prompt:
Return a dictionary with items from *d1* not contained in *d2*.

*level* sets the maximum depth of recursion. For infinite recursion,
set that to -1. For level 1,
if a key is present both in *d1* and *d2* but has different values,
it is included into the difference.
See :func:`intersection` for more details.

*d1* and *d2* remain unchanged. However, *d1* or some of its
subdictionaries may be returned directly.
Make a deep copy of the result when appropriate.

.. versionadded:: 0.5
   add keyword argument *level*.

steps:

1. **Check Key Existence**: Iterate through each key in `d1`. If a key is not present in `d2`, add it to the result dictionary.
2. **Compare Values at Current Level**: For keys present in both `d1` and `d2`, retrieve their values `v1` and `v2`.
3. **Handle Level 0 Comparison**: If `level` is 0, directly compare `v1` and `v2` using inequality. If they differ, include the key-value pair from `d1` in the result.
4. **Recursive Check for Dictionaries**: If `v1` and `v2` are both dictionaries and `level` is not 0, recursively compute their difference with an adjusted level (decrement by 1 if `level` is positive, else keep as -1 for unlimited depth).
5. **Non-Dict Value Comparison**: If either `v1` or `v2` is not a dictionary, compare them directly. If they differ, include the key-value pair from `d1`.
6. **Adjust Levels for Recursion**: For each recursive call, decrease the `level` by 1 if it's positive to track the depth limit, maintaining `-1` for unlimited recursion.
7. **Build Result Based on Differences**: If any differences are found at the current or nested levels, include the corresponding key-value pair from `d1` in the result.
