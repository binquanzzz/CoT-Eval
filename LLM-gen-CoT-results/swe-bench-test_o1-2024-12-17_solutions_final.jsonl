Understand the issue: The problem stems from handling time truncation, especially when truncating to a time that could be ambiguous or non-existent, as seen with daylight saving time transitions.\n\n   1.1 The error occurs when the `Trunc()` function tries to truncate a datetime to a time that doesn't exist (due to daylight saving time transitions) or is ambiguous (e.g., the same time occurring twice).\n   \n   1.2 In this case, the `AmbiguousTimeError` or `NonExistentTimeError` is raised by the `pytz` library when trying to make a datetime aware in a timezone that has DST (Daylight Saving Time) transitions.\n\n   1.3 The goal is to handle this error gracefully by introducing an optional `is_dst` argument in `Trunc()` to control the behavior when these errors occur.\n\n2.

Test the code thoroughly:\n\n   4.1 Ensure that the `Trunc()` function works with various edge cases such as time zones with ambiguous or non-existent times.\n   \n   4.2 Ensure that `is_dst=None` falls back to the default behavior without raising any exceptions.\n"], "model_patch": "\n--- a/django/db/models/functions/datetime.py\n+++ b/django/db/models/functions/datetime.py\n@@ -171,7 +171,8 @@\n \n     def __init__(self, expression, output_field=None, tzinfo=None, **extra):\n         self.tzinfo = tzinfo\n         super().__init__(expression, output_field=output_field, **extra)\n \n-    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):\n+    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection, is_dst=None):\n         inner_sql, inner_params = compiler.compile(self.lhs)\n         if isinstance(self.output_field, DateTimeField):\n             tzname = self.get_tzname()\n-            sql = connection.ops.datetime_trunc_sql(self.kind, inner_sql, tzname)\n+            sql = connection.ops.datetime_trunc_sql(self.kind, inner_sql, tzname, is_dst)\n         elif isinstance(self.output_field, DateField):\n             sql = connection.ops.date_trunc_sql(self.kind, inner_sql)\n         elif isinstance(self.output_field, TimeField):\n             sql = connection.ops.time_trunc_sql(self.kind, inner_sql)\n         else:\n             raise ValueError('Trunc only valid on DateField, TimeField, or DateTimeField.')\n         return sql, inner_params\n \n --- a/django/utils/timezone.py\n+++ b/django/utils/timezone.py\n@@ -264,7 +264,8 @@\n     \"\"\"Make a naive datetime.datetime in a given time zone aware.\"\"\"\n     if timezone is None:\n         timezone = get_current_timezone()\n     if hasattr(timezone, 'localize'):\n         # This method is available for pytz time zones.\n-        return timezone.localize(value)\n+        return timezone.localize(value, is_dst=is_dst)\n     else:\n         # Check that we won't overwrite the timezone of an aware datetime.\n         if is_aware(value):\n             raise ValueError(\n                 \"make_aware expects a naive datetime, got %s\" % value)\n         # This may be wrong around DST changes!\n         return value.replace(tzinfo=timezone)\n --- a/django/db/models/functions/datetime.py\n+++ b/django/db/models/functions/datetime.py\n@@ -218,7 +218,8 @@\n \n     def resolve_expression(self, query=None, allow_joins=True, reuse=None, summarize=False, for_save=False):\n         copy = super().resolve_expression(query, allow_joins, reuse, summarize, for_save)\n         field = copy.lhs.output_field\n         # DateTimeField is a subclass of DateField so this works for both.\n         assert isinstance(field, (DateField, TimeField)), (\n             \"%r isn't a DateField, TimeField, or DateTimeField.\" % field.name\n         )\n         # If self.output_field was None, then accessing the field will trigger\n         # the resolver to assign it to self.lhs.output_field.\n         if not isinstance(copy.output_field, (DateField, DateTimeField, TimeField)):\n             raise ValueError('output_field must be either DateField, TimeField, or DateTimeField')\n         # Passing dates or times to functions expecting datetimes is most\n         # likely a mistake.\n         class_output_field = self.__class__.output_field if isinstance(self.__class__.output_field, Field) else None\n         output_field = class_output_field or copy.output_field\n         has_explicit_output_field = class_output_field or field.__class__ is not copy.output_field.__class__\n         if type(field) == DateField and (\n@@ -204,7 +205,7 @@\n             raise ValueError(\"Cannot truncate DateField '%s' to %s. \" % (\n                 field.name, output_field.__class__.__name__ if has_explicit_output_field else 'DateTimeField'\n             ))\n         elif isinstance(field, TimeField) and (\n             isinstance(output_field, DateTimeField) or\n             copy.kind in ('year', 'quarter', 'month', 'week', 'day', 'date')):\n             raise ValueError(\"Cannot truncate TimeField '%s' to %s. \" % (\n                 field.name, output_field.__class__.__name__ if has_explicit_output_field else 'DateTimeField'\n             ))\n         return copy\n --- a/django/db/models/functions/datetime.py\n+++ b/django/db/models/functions/datetime.py\n@@ -195,7 +195,8 @@\n \n     def convert_value(self, value, expression, connection):\n         if isinstance(self.output_field, DateTimeField):\n             if not settings.USE_TZ:\n                 pass\n             elif value is not None:\n-                value = timezone.make_aware(value, self.tzinfo)\n+                value = timezone.make_aware(value, self.tzinfo, is_dst=None)\n             elif not connection.features.has_zoneinfo_database:\n                 raise ValueError(\n                     'Database returned an invalid datetime value.

Locate the files for modification\n   2.1 From the code provided, identify the relevant files where this feature should be added.\n       2.1.1 `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py` contains feature flags for the SQLite backend.\n       2.1.2 `django/db/backends/sqlite3/introspection.py` contains the introspection logic for SQLite.\n       2.1.3 Modifications should be made to both these files to support sequence resetting.\n\n3. Modify `features.py` to enable sequence reset functionality\n   3.1 Update the `supports_sequence_reset` flag to `True` to indicate that this feature will be supported in SQLite.\n   3.2 This change will enable the backend to make use of the `sqlite_sequence` table for sequence resetting.\n\n4. Modify `introspection.py` to add the reset functionality\n   4.1 Add a method to the `DatabaseIntrospection` class to reset sequences using the `sqlite_sequence` table.\n   4.2 This method will query the `sqlite_sequence` table to identify the sequences and reset them to their current values.\n\n5. Test the functionality\n   5.1 After applying the changes, ensure that sequences can be reset correctly when required.\n   5.2 You can do this by writing a test case to verify that sequences in SQLite can be reset to the correct value after inserting records.\n\n6. Update the documentation\n   6.1 Modify the `README.rst` or relevant documentation files to reflect that SQLite now supports sequence resetting.\n   6.2 This ensures that users are aware of the new feature and can use it appropriately.\n\n</step>\n\n<patch>\n--- a/django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py\n@@ -29,7 +29,7 @@\n     supports_transactions = True\n     atomic_transactions = False\n     can_rollback_ddl = True\n     supports_atomic_references_rename = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 26, 0)\n     can_create_inline_fk = False\n     supports_paramstyle_pyformat = False\n     supports_sequence_reset = False\n+    supports_sequence_reset = True\n     can_clone_databases = True\n     supports_temporal_subtraction = True\n     ignores_table_name_case = True\n     supports_cast_with_precision = False\n     time_cast_precision = 3\n     can_release_savepoints = True\n --- a/django/db/backends/sqlite3/introspection.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/sqlite3/introspection.py\n@@ -157,6 +157,21 @@\n         return constraints\n     \n+    def reset_sequences(self, cursor, table_name):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Reset the sequence for the given table in SQLite.\n+        This updates the sequence in the sqlite_sequence table.\n+        \"\"\"\n+        cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n+            SELECT name, seq FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name = ?\n+        \"\"\", [table_name])\n+        row = cursor.fetchone()\n+        if row:\n+            cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n+                UPDATE sqlite_sequence SET seq = 0 WHERE name = ?\n+            \"\"\", [table_name])\n+            return True\n+        return False\n+\n --- a/django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py\n@@ -29,7 +29,7 @@\n     supports_transactions = True\n     atomic_transactions = False\n     can_rollback_ddl = True\n     supports_atomic_references_rename = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 26, 0)\n     can_create_inline_fk = False\n     supports_paramstyle_pyformat = False\n     supports_sequence_reset = False\n+    supports_sequence_reset = True\n     can_clone_databases = True\n     supports_temporal_subtraction = True\n     ignores_table_name_case = True\n     supports_cast_with_precision = False\n     time_cast_precision = 3\n     can_release_savepoints = True\n</patch>", "steps": ["\n1.

Identify where collations are relevant:\n   2.1 Look for places in the code where database fields are defined, especially in `django/db/models/options.py`, as this file holds model metadata and field configurations.\n   2.2 Check the `Options` class, which defines various model behaviors, including ordering, indexes, constraints, etc.\n   2.3 Explore model field definitions and database-specific behaviors that may need to be customized to support collations.\n\n3.

Understand the problem and requirements.\n    1.1 The issue involves adding a \"durable\" flag to the `transaction.atomic()` function in Django.\n    1.2 This flag should ensure that the wrapped database operations are not only atomic but also durable.\n    1.3 Currently, `atomic()` guarantees that database operations are atomic, but it does not guarantee that the operations will definitely be committed, especially when wrapped by another `atomic()` block at a higher level.\n    1.4 The solution involves adding a \"durable\" flag that will enforce a commitment of the transaction after the wrapped block is executed.\n\n2. Modify `transaction.atomic()` to accept the \"durable\" flag.\n    2.1 Add the `durable` parameter to the `atomic()` function in `django/db/transaction.py`.\n    2.2 The `durable` flag should be passed to the `Atomic` context manager.\n    2.3 The \"durable\" flag should be used to ensure that if there is an already active atomic block, an exception is raised.\n\n3. Modify the `Atomic` context manager to support the \"durable\" flag.\n    3.1 Update the `Atomic` class to check for the \"durable\" flag.\n    3.2 If the flag is set to `True` and there is already an active atomic block (`in_atomic_block` is `True`), raise an error indicating that durability is not possible.\n    3.3 Ensure that if the \"durable\" flag is set to `True`, the transaction is committed immediately after the block executes.\n    3.4 Update the context manager's `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to respect the \"durable\" flag.\n\n4. Add tests for the \"durable\" flag.\n    4.1 Create test cases that ensure the \"durable\" flag works correctly, including scenarios where a `durable` transaction is nested inside another atomic block.\n    4.2 Test cases should check for both atomicity and durability, ensuring no rollback occurs when the durable flag is set.\n    4.3 Ensure that an exception is raised when trying to wrap a durable transaction inside another atomic block.\n\n5.

Modify the `Atomic` context manager to support the \"durable\" flag.\n    3.1 Update the `Atomic` class to check for the \"durable\" flag.\n    3.2 If the flag is set to `True` and there is already an active atomic block (`in_atomic_block` is `True`), raise an error indicating that durability is not possible.\n    3.3 Ensure that if the \"durable\" flag is set to `True`, the transaction is committed immediately after the block executes.\n    3.4 Update the context manager's `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to respect the \"durable\" flag.\n\n4. Add tests for the \"durable\" flag.\n    4.1 Create test cases that ensure the \"durable\" flag works correctly, including scenarios where a `durable` transaction is nested inside another atomic block.\n    4.2 Test cases should check for both atomicity and durability, ensuring no rollback occurs when the durable flag is set.\n    4.3 Ensure that an exception is raised when trying to wrap a durable transaction inside another atomic block.\n\n5. Update the documentation.\n    5.1 Document the new \"durable\" flag in the relevant parts of the Django documentation.\n    5.2 Provide usage examples for how to use the \"durable\" flag with `transaction.atomic()`.\n"], "model_patch": "\n--- a/django/db/transaction.py\n+++ b/django/db/transaction.py\n@@ -285,7 +285,7 @@\n     # Bare decorator: @atomic -- although the first argument is called\n     # `using`, it's actually the function being decorated.\n     if callable(using):\n-        return Atomic(DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS, savepoint)(using)\n+        return Atomic(DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS, savepoint, durable=False)(using)\n     # Decorator: @atomic(...) or context manager: with atomic(...): ...\n     else:\n-        return Atomic(using, savepoint)\n+        return Atomic(using, savepoint, durable=False)\n \n--- a/django/db/transaction.py\n+++ b/django/db/transaction.py\n@@ -164,6 +164,7 @@\n         self.savepoint = savepoint\n+        self.durable = durable\n         \n     def __enter__(self):\n         connection = get_connection(self.using)\n         \n+        if self.durable and connection.in_atomic_block:\n+            raise TransactionManagementError(\"Cannot start a durable transaction inside another atomic block.\")\n         if not connection.in_atomic_block:\n             # Reset state when entering an outermost atomic block.\n             connection.commit_on_exit = True\n             connection.needs_rollback = False\n             if not connection.get_autocommit():\n                 # Pretend we're already in an atomic block to bypass the code\n                 # that disables autocommit to enter a transaction, and make a\n                 # note to deal with this case in __exit__.\n                 connection.in_atomic_block = True\n                 connection.commit_on_exit = False\n         \n     def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n         connection = get_connection(self.using)\n         \n+        if self.durable and not connection.in_atomic_block:\n+            connection.commit()\n         \n         if connection.savepoint_ids:\n             sid = connection.savepoint_ids.pop()\n         else:\n             # Prematurely unset this flag to allow using commit or rollback.\n             connection.in_atomic_block = False\n         \n         try:\n             if connection.closed_in_transaction:\n                 # The database will perform a rollback by itself.\n                 # Wait until we exit the outermost block.\n                 pass\n             elif exc_type is None and not connection.needs_rollback:\n                 if connection.in_atomic_block:\n                     # Release savepoint if there is one\n                     if sid is not None:\n                         try:\n                             connection.savepoint_commit(sid)\n                         except DatabaseError:\n                             try:\n                                 connection.savepoint_rollback(sid)\n                                 # The savepoint won't be reused.

This will mostly be done through `handler.addQuickElement`.  \n    2.2 Check for the use of self-closing tags, specifically the `<category>` and `<enclosure>` tags. These should be changed to self-closing tags where applicable.\n\n3. **Modify the `addQuickElement` calls**  \n    3.1 Alter `addQuickElement` in `RssFeed` and `Atom1Feed` to support self-closing tags when no content is present.  \n    3.2 Ensure that `addQuickElement` is adjusted to respect self-closing tags where needed (e.g., `<category />` or `<enclosure />` instead of `<category></category>` if there\u2019s no content).  \n    3.3 Make sure these changes follow the XML standards for self-closing tags to ensure compatibility with XML parsers.\n\n4. **Test and verify feed generation**  \n    4.1 Write test cases or use existing ones to ensure that the generated RSS and Atom feeds correctly implement self-closing tags.  \n    4.2 Test for backward compatibility with feeds generated by previous versions of Django to ensure the modification does not break existing functionality.  \n    4.3 Ensure that the generated feeds meet the RSS and Atom specifications, confirming that

the repository using `git apply`.  \n    5.2 Ensure the patch includes changes only for adding support for self-closing tags without modifying any unrelated functionality in the syndication feed

how the syndication feeds are currently being generated, focusing on the `django.utils.feedgenerator` module.  \n    1.2 Identify that `SimplerXMLGenerator` is being used to write RSS and Atom feeds, which does not support self-closing tags.  \n    1.3 Understand the function and purpose of `feedgenerator.DefaultFeed`, `RssFeed`, and `Atom1Feed` classes in generating RSS and Atom feeds.  \n\n2. **Locate the required areas for modification**  \n    2.1 Identify where XML tags are written in the `RssFeed` and `Atom1Feed` classes. This will mostly be done through `handler.addQuickElement`.  \n    2.2 Check for the use of self-closing tags, specifically the `<category>` and `<enclosure>` tags. These should be changed to self-closing tags where applicable.\n\n3. **Modify the `addQuickElement` calls**  \n    3.1 Alter `addQuickElement` in `RssFeed` and `Atom1Feed` to support self-closing tags when no content is present.  \n    3.2 Ensure that `addQuickElement` is adjusted to respect self-closing tags where needed (e.g., `<category />` or `<enclosure />` instead of `<category></category>` if there\u2019s no content).  \n    3.3 Make sure these changes follow the XML standards for self-closing tags to ensure compatibility with XML parsers.\n\n4. **Test and verify feed generation**  \n    4.1 Write test cases or use existing ones to ensure that the generated RSS and Atom feeds correctly implement self-closing tags.  \n    4.2 Test for backward compatibility with feeds generated by previous versions of Django to ensure the modification does not break existing functionality.  \n    4.3 Ensure that the generated feeds meet the RSS and Atom specifications, confirming that self-closing tags are correctly implemented and valid.\n\n5. **Prepare a patch for the changes**  \n    5.1 After testing and ensuring the correct functionality, create a patch that can be applied to the repository using `git apply`.  \n    5.2 Ensure the patch includes changes only for adding support for self-closing tags without modifying any unrelated functionality in the syndication feed code.\n\n"], "model_patch": "\n--- django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n+++ django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n@@ -211,7 +211,7 @@\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"title\", self.feed['title'])\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"link\", self.feed['link'])\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"description\", self.feed['description'])\n-            handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", cat)\n+            handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", cat, self._get_dynamic_attr('category_attributes', self.feed) or {})\n         if self.feed['feed_copyright'] is not None:\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"copyright\", self.feed['feed_copyright'])\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"lastBuildDate\", rfc2822_date(self.latest_post_date()))\n@@ -225,7 +225,7 @@\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"ttl\", self.feed['ttl'])\n \n --- django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n+++ django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n@@ -246,7 +246,7 @@\n         if item['categories']:\n             for cat in item['categories']:\n-                handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", cat)\n+                handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", cat, self._get_dynamic_attr('category_attributes', item) or {})\n         if item['enclosures']:\n             for enclosure in item['enclosures']:\n-                handler.addQuickElement('enclosure', '', {\n+                handler.addQuickElement('enclosure', '', {\n@@ -261,7 +261,7 @@\n         if item['comments'] is not None:\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"comments\", item['comments'])\n         if item['unique_id'] is not None:\n             guid_attrs = {}\n             if isinstance(item.get('unique_id_is_permalink'), bool):\n@@ -261,7 +261,7 @@\n         if item['comments'] is not None:\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"comments\", item['comments'])\n         if item['unique_id'] is not None:\n             guid_attrs = {}\n             if isinstance(item.get('unique_id_is_permalink'), bool):\n--- django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n+++ django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n@@ -316,7 +316,7 @@\n             handler.addQuickElement(\"link\", \"\", {\"rel\": \"self\", \"href\": self.feed['feed_url']})\n         handler.addQuickElement(\"id\", self.feed['id'])\n         handler.addQuickElement(\"updated\", rfc3339_date(self.latest_post_date()))\n         if self.feed['author_name'] is not None:\n@@ -331,7 +331,7 @@\n         for cat in self.feed['categories']:\n-            handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", \"\", {\"term\": cat})\n+            handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", \"\", {\"term\": cat, \"xml:lang\": self.feed['language']})\n \n --- django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n+++ django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n@@ -340,7 +340,7 @@\n         if item['categories']:\n             for cat in item['categories']:\n-                handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", \"\", {\"term\": cat})\n+                handler.addQuickElement(\"category\", \"\", {\"term\": cat, \"xml:lang\": self.feed['language']})\n --- django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n+++ django/utils/feedgenerator.py\n@@ -272,7 +272,7 @@\n         if item['enclosures']:\n-            handler.addQuickElement('enclosure', '', {\n+            handler.addQuickElement('enclosure', '', {\n                 'url': enclosure.url,\n                 'length': enclosure.length,\n                 'type': enclosure.mime_type,\n             })\n ", "model_name_or_path": "o1-2024-12-17"}

This involves updating the test database name with the `test_` prefix.\n   2.3 Test the implementation on both macOS and Windows to ensure compatibility with the `spawn` process start method.\n\n3. **Create a patch for the changes**\n   3.1 Modify the necessary files to implement the fixes: Ensure that `django.setup()` is called in the worker initialization and that the database name is set with the correct prefix.\n   3.2 Ensure that the changes are backward-compatible with the default `fork` start method on Unix-based systems.\n\n4. **Test the solution**\n   4.1 Run the tests with the `--parallel` flag on both macOS and Windows to verify that the issue is resolved.\n   4.2 Ensure that no other test failures or database-related issues are present during the tests.\n</step>\n\nNow I will generate the patch to fix the issue.

Understand the current behavior of the `bulk_create` method in Django when conflicts occur.\n    1.2. Verify that the primary keys are not returned when `update_conflicts` is enabled.\n    1.3. Confirm that the problem lies in the lack of `RETURNING my_model.id` in the query generated during `bulk_create`.\n\n2. **Modify PostgreSQL Backend to Support Returning IDs for Update Conflicts**\n    2.1. Locate the PostgreSQL-specific `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method in the `postgresql/operations.py` file.\n    2.2. Modify the method to append `RETURNING my_model.id` when `update_conflicts` is used.\n    2.3. Ensure that the change doesn't affect other database backends.\n\n3. **Ensure Compatibility with `bulk_create` in Django**\n    3.1. Modify the `bulk_create` method to handle the returned IDs properly after the change in PostgreSQL operations.\n    3.2. Ensure that other features, such as conflict resolution, are still functional.\n\n4. **Testing the Fix**\n    4.1.
